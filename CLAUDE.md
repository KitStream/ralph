## Operating principles
1) Prefer clear code over comments.
    - Use comments only for: non-obvious reasoning, security invariants, protocol quirks, or “why” that code cannot express.
    - Prefer descriptive names, small functions, and explicit types over commentary.

2) Solve root cause, not band-aids.
    - Do not add retries/timeouts/logging to hide failures unless the root cause is addressed or explicitly impossible to fix.
    - If a workaround is necessary, document the root cause and the exact reason it can’t be fixed now.

3) Use idioms of the language and ecosystem.
    - Follow standard style guides, conventions, directory layout, and tooling.
    - Avoid clever patterns that fight the ecosystem. Prefer boring, maintainable solutions.

5) Documentation for all features.
    - Every new feature must have usage docs + one runnable example.
    - Docs must include intent, flags/config, and failure modes.
    - Prefer docs that answer user questions (“How do I…”) and include copy/paste snippets.

Robustness & correctness
7) Include error handling everywhere it matters.
    - Never ignore errors; propagate with context.
    - Wrap/annotate errors so the caller has actionable info.
    - Ensure exit codes/return values are correct and consistent.

8) Test edge cases and invariants.
    - Add tests for: empty inputs, invalid inputs, boundary values, timeouts, large payloads (reasonable), and concurrency/ordering if relevant.
    - Include at least one test for each bug fixed to prevent regressions.

Security & safety (important for agentic tooling)
9) No harmful actions by default.
    - Do not delete data, rotate secrets, publish releases, or mutate external systems unless explicitly requested.
    - Treat external calls (network, cloud APIs) as “dangerous”: require explicit opt-in via config/flags.

10) Least privilege and safe defaults.
- Minimize permissions, capabilities, scopes, and access tokens.
- For Kubernetes artifacts: runAsNonRoot, readOnlyRootFilesystem, allowPrivilegeEscalation=false, drop ALL capabilities unless justified.

11) No secret leakage.
- Never print tokens, passwords, or full credential material to logs.
- Redact known secret patterns; avoid echoing env vars that might contain secrets.

12) Deterministic builds and reproducibility.
- Prefer pinned versions, lockfiles, and deterministic packaging.
- Avoid “download latest at build time” unless necessary.

Change management rules
13) Small, reviewable diffs.
- Prefer incremental changes with clear commit boundaries.
- If a refactor is needed, do it in a separate commit/PR before feature changes.

14) Respect existing standards and tooling.
- Use the repo's existing lint/format/test tools (Makefile/package scripts/cargo test/etc.).
- If tooling is missing, add it in a minimal conventional way.

Agent execution constraints (for local runners / GH actions)
16) Only modify files that are in-scope for the task.
- Do not reformat unrelated files.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless justified.

17) When uncertain, choose the safer option and make it explicit.
- Prefer failing fast with actionable errors over silent fallback.
- If ambiguity remains, implement a guardrail and document the decision.

Definition of done
- Code compiles without warnings.
- Code is linted.
- Code is formatted.
- All tests pass 
- Docs updated (or created if missing)
- Security posture maintained.
- For rust code:
  - Run `cargo fmt` (format the workspace or the crates you touched; keep diffs free of rustfmt noise).
  - All unsafe code is annotated.
  - Use explicit lifetimes where necessary.
  - Use clippy lints.
